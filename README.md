## Overview  
This repository contains all project submissions and experiments completed as part of the **BMI/CEN 598 – Embedded Machine Learning** course at **Arizona State University (Fall B 2025)**.  
Each project explores a unique embedded systems concept combining **microcontroller programming**, **state machine design**, **sensing**, and **intelligent decision-making** on low-power devices such as the **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**.

## Project List  

#### 🔹 [Project 1: Embedded State Machine using Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](./Project1/)

**Description:**  
A finite state machine was implemented using the onboard RGB LED of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.  
The system reacts to serial input (`C` key) and internal timers to cycle through LED color states representing **DARK → RED → BLUE → GREEN → DARK**.

**Features:**  
- Event-driven design using `millis()` (non-blocking timing).  
- LED control and serial-based input simulation.  
- Automatic timeout transitions with unique delays per state.  
- Demonstrated real-time reactive embedded behavior.
